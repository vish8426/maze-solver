TurtleBot Mechatronic System

## About
The problem or exercise requires the Turtlebot to successfully complete or solve a maze. This is to be both in a simulation as well as a physical model. The physical model of the maze is to be created using cardboard with the Turtlebot moving through the cardboard environment (where most of the material is utilized represents the maze walls). The simulation is modelled with a combination of programs including:
- RViz
- Gazebo 
- ROS Kinetic & Melodic 
- Ubuntu 18.04 & 16.04
